<h1>Why did I choose Rice Krispies Treats</h1>
<p>I decided to layout the instructions for a Rice Krispies Treats recipe because they are my absolute favorite snack/treat. I recently made these with my family so it seemed fitting to do a basic tutorial on how to make these delicious, gooey squares. </p>
<p>This treat is more than just a heap of butter and sugar, it's a nostalgic past-time that takes me back to the good old days. My family always makes these for holidays, birthdays, or any special occasion. I remember taking a cooler of them to the beach, or the sweet taste of one after a sports game. There never is a bad time for a Rice Krispies Treat.</p>
