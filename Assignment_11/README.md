My work cycle for this assignment was an absolute disaster. I felt as though there wasn't enough instruction, and I had to literally just try random things to see if they would work. This was the hardest assignment so far and it took forever. I have no idea what I did wrong, but the art is not displaying how I had it before. I really struggled doing this assignment.
