My work cycle for this assignment was very rough. I had to do a lot of trial and error to see if I was going the right direction. Luckily, it was just a small mistake with a bracket (of course), but besides that everything else was pretty smooth. I'm becoming more comfortable with positioning, which was my biggest weakness before this assignment.
