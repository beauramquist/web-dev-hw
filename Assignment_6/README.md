There are many different forms that I've seen surfing the web. There are address and billing forms where you enter your information in order to make purchases online. They have multiple drop down menu's and other functions on these forms. Also checking boxes to make sure you've read the terms and conditions or verifying age is another form that I've come across.
Text input can be used to enter age or name details, selection input can be used to ask questions where there are predetermined, definite answers like are you a graduate or undergraduate student, and button input is useful for multiple choice questions.
My work cycle was similar to last assignment. Basically breaking down each step and then referencing the website instructions for each individual step. I constantly check my work through opening my index in Chrome to check if my page layout is formatted correctly.
