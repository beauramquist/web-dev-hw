I believe that there can just be one of each per page. The head is essentially the thoughts of the page, including things like title, author, and date. The body is the meat and potatoes of the webpage and contains lists, paragraphs, and the content that is visible to the user.
Semantic markup is used to put emphasis on what's important in the phrase by bolding or underlining it, they also provide quotes or links to definitions. Structural markup is concerned with the main foundation of the document. This type of markup deals with the headings, paragraphs, breaks, and lists and how they're ordered/structured.
My work cycle for this assignment begins with familiarizing myself with the new definitions/walkthroughs, and then slowly tackle each step. I use the website as a reference if I forget how to do something or I need to double check how to put in a code. This was the first time not having a detailed walkthrough, but I found this assignment easier than the last ones. I think I'm improving using Atom, and I like that I can check my work by opening my index in google chrome to see what the layout looks like. I was pleased with how my milkshake recipe page turned out.
