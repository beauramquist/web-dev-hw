In this final section, I didn't learn anything new about Github or version control, but all of this information is still very new to me.
I learned how to make a dropdown menu in my final project, but overall everything I learn about html or web dev is very new to me because I have never used html software before. Every assignment I have done has been a challenge, but also a rewarding experience considering the progress I've made thus far.
My work cycle for this assignment was similar to the combination of my other weekly assignments that allowed me to get this far to create a final website. I referenced each module if I needed help with media, fonts, positioning, etc. I am very proud of what I have accomplished in this class even though it's not too complex. For a first time web dev student, I am happy with how far I've come from a few weeks ago.
