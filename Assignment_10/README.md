System fonts are the ones already installed on our local devices, web fonts we get from a server like google fonts, web-safe fonts are reliable fonts that are common on both MAC and PC like times new roman.
Fallback fonts are pretty self explanatory, as they provide an additional backup font in case the primary one you use has problems loading. They are always very similar to the primary font you planned on using initially.
My work cycle remains to be pretty similar to my past assignments. We explored using fonts and pseudo-elements, which serve to be very useful as I plan out my final website that I will be making over the next few days. I was confused about divs and classes on the last README, but luckily I have become more familiar with using them as I will need to utilize them in my final.
