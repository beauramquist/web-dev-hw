<p>"So the boy . . . the boy must die?” asked Snape quite calmly. <br/>
“And Voldemort himself must do it, Severus. That is essential.” <br/>
Another long silence. Then Snape said, “I thought . . . all these years . . . that we were <br/>
protecting him for her. For Lily.” <br/>
“We have protected him because it has been essential to teach him, to raise him, to let <br/>
him try his strength,” said Dumbledore, his eyes still tight shut. “Meanwhile, the<br/>
connection between them grows ever stronger, a parasitic growth: Sometimes I have<br/>
thought he suspects it himself. If I know him, he will have arranged matters so that when<br/>
he does set out to meet his death, it will truly mean the end of Voldemort.” <br/>
Dumbledore opened his eyes. Snape looked horrified. “You have kept him alive so that <br/>
he can die at the right moment?” <br/>
“Don’t be shocked, Severus. How many men and women have you watched die?” <br/>
“Lately, only those whom I could not save,” said Snape. He stood up. “You have used me.” <br/>
“Meaning?” <br/>
“I have spied for you and lied for you, put myself in mortal danger for you. Everything<br/>
was supposed to be to keep Lily Potter’s son safe. Now you tell me you have been raising <br/>
him like a pig for slaughter —” <br/>
“But this is touching, Severus,” said Dumbledore seriously. “Have you grown to care for <br/>
the boy, after all?” <br/>
<b>“For HIM?”</b> shouted Snape. “Expecto Patronum!" From the tip of his wand burst the <br/>
silver doe: She landed on the office floor, bounded once across the office, and soared out<br/>
of the window. Dumbledore watched her fly away, and as her silvery glow faded he <br/>
turned back to Snape, and his eyes were full of tears. <br/>
“After all this time?”<br/>
“Always,” said Snape.
