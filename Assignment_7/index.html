<h1>Lyrics</h1>
<p>Uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh, yeah, uh, yeah <br/>
And I heard 'em say, nothin's ever promised tomorrow today <br/>
From the Chi, like Tim its the Hard-a-way <br/>
So this is in the name of love, like Rob would say <br/>
Before you ask me to get a job today <br/>
Can I at least get a raise on a minimum wage? <br/>
And I know the government administered AIDS <br/>
So I guess we just pray like the minister say <br/>
Allahu Akbar and throw 'em some hot cars <br/>
Things we seen on the screen are not ours <br/>
But these niggas from the hood so these dreams not far <br/>
Where I'm from, the dope boys is the rock stars <br/>
But they can't cop cars without seein' cop cars <br/>
I guess they want us all behind bars, I know it <br/>
</p>
<p>
Uh, and I heard 'em say, nothin's ever promised tomorrow today <br/>
And I heard 'em say (nothin's ever promised tomorrow today) but we'll find a way <br/>
(And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only way) <br/>
<p/>
<p>
They say people in your life are seasons <br/>
And anything that happen is for a reason <br/>
And niggas guns clappin' and keep to squeezin' <br/>
And Gran' keep prayin' and keep believin' <br/>
And Jesus, and one day that she'll see him <br/>
Till they walk in his footsteps and try to be him <br/>
The devil is alive I feel him breathin' <br/>
Claimin' money is the key so keep on dreamin' <br/>
And put those lottery tickets just to tease us <br/>
My aunt Pam can't put those cigarettes down <br/>
Now my lil' cousin smokin' those cigarettes now <br/>
His job trying to claim that he too nigger-ish now <br/>
Is it 'cause his skin blacker than licorice now? <br/>
I can't figure it out, I'm sick of the noun <br/>
<p/>
<p>
Uh, and I heard 'em say, nothin's ever promised tomorrow today <br/>
And I heard 'em say (nothin's ever promised tomorrow today) but we'll find a way <br/>
(And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe, it hurts but it may be the only way) <br/>
<p/>
<p>
Cause every worthless word we got more far away <br/>
And nothing's ever promised tomorrow today <br/>
And nothing lasts forever but be honest babe <br/>
It hurts but it may be the only way </p>
