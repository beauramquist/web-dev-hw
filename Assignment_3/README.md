Web browsers interpret a collection of different information and display them as webpages that are more visually pleasing. I use Google Chrome and Internet Explorer.
Markup is essentially what you see in a web browser with an emphasis on text. It serves as the blueprints of the webpage. HTML does just this as it constructs the webpage's foundation and organizes the content.
